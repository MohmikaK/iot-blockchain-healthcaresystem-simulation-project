# The IoT Blockchain Healthcare project leverages Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain technology to enhance healthcare monitoring and data integrity. The project utilizes simulation of sensors such as ECG, temperature, and SPO2 sensors to continuously gather patient health data. This data is recorded and securely stored on a blockchain, ensuring immutability, transparency, and traceability. By integrating blockchain, the project guarantees that the health records are tamper-proof and accessible only to authorized parties, thereby improving data security and trust in healthcare information management.
